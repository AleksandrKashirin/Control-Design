This repository covers topics related to Control Design.
1. Crane Stabilization System is model of a top overhead crane which is controlled with an  Adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller with recalculated physical model and Kalman Filter.
2. Twin Rotor MIMO System represents a model of helicopter which is controlled with an Linear Quadritic Regulator (LQR) controller and Pole-Placement Estimator. Animation and code can be seen on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO82lOvXjQ8&ab_channel=%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD
